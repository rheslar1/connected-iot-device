# Connected IoT Device

RTOS-based sensor node with MQTT cloud integration, signed OTA updates, low-power operating modes, and TLS-backed device identity.

## Portfolio Purpose

This repository is an Embedded Systems project scaffold for the Rheslar portfolio. It is designed to become a hardware-backed project with build output, validation logs, and reviewable implementation evidence.

All generated Embedded Systems repos are C++17-first and are framed around C++ design patterns and SOLID design principles.

## Stack

- C++17
- C++ Design Patterns
- SOLID
- FreeRTOS/Zephyr
- MQTT
- TLS
- OTA
- Low power modes
- Device identity

## Quick Start

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/connected_iot_device
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Implementation Slices

- C++17 starter executable that exposes the project identity, stack, and validation target.
- Small strategy-style readiness check that keeps the scaffold aligned with C++ design patterns.
- Architecture document with control boundaries, data flow, safety assumptions, and evidence plan.
- CTest smoke test that keeps source, docs, and CI files present as the repo grows.
- GitHub Actions workflow for configure, build, executable smoke run, and repository validation.

## Evidence Target

End-to-end connected-device architecture, secure cloud messaging, field-update readiness, and measured battery-aware behavior.

## Remote

Intended public repository: https://github.com/rheslar1/connected-iot-device

## C++17, Design Patterns, and SOLID Implementation

This repository includes a host-buildable C++17 implementation, not only documentation. The implementation applies:

- Strategy pattern for validation rules.
- Adapter interfaces for input samples and telemetry/reporting.
- Composite validation for combining safety and readiness checks.
- Facade orchestration through the project runtime class.
- SOLID boundaries between profile data, input acquisition, validation, telemetry encoding, and tests.
